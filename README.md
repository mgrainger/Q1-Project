# Q1-Project: Golf Search App

* My web application will allow a user to see all the golf courses in their region, mark the ones they've played, and see a list of other courses to check off their "golf bucket list".  Users will be able to filter viable courses to play based on public/private, cost, travel distance, etc.

* Public golfers have the same difficulty choosing a course to play as people do selecting wine.  Golfers forget how many options they have, where they've played, costs, and distances.

* My project will access the Google Places API and/or the Swing by Swing API to populate a list of potential courses per region selected by the user.   It will filter out courses not playable by the user, and potentially create a dashboard for users to pin courses they'd like to play.

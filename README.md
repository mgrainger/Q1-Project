# Q1-Project: Golf Search App

* My web application allows users to see golf courses based on the location they search, mark the ones they've played, and see contact and website information of potential new coureses to play.  Users are able to filter viable courses to play based on public/private, cost, travel distance, etc.

* Public golfers have the same difficulty choosing a course to play as people do selecting wine.  Few websites show golfers what courses are playable near them and because of this, golfers also forget how many options they have, where they've played, costs, and distances.

* This application uses the Swing by Swing API to access specific information per golf course.  It cross references that information with the Google Maps API to show per-course markers on the map.  Users can also click on each course's address to see the driving directions on Google Maps.
